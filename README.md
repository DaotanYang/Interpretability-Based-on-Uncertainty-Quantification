# Interpretability-Based-on-Uncertainty-Quantification
Research and Application of Deep Learning Model Interpretability Based on Uncertainty Quantification
This project is based on the paper:Understanding Measures of Uncertainty for Adversarial Example Detection-Lewis Smith and Yarin Gal.We made some changes based on their code.
LeNet5, ResNet-34 and AlexNet models are based on https://github.com/rookiedata1/Keras-CNN-mnist-classification.We made some changes based on the code.
